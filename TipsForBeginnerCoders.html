    <h1>5 Tips For People Learning How To Code</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>Hello all, my name is Marion. I have been coding for 9 months starting last september. Learning how to code can seem
    like a daunting task for beginners. But if you follow my advice you should be all set. Here's 5 tips to help you
    out along the way.</p>

<h2> 1. Have A Goal </h2>

<p> Having a direction when learning how to code helps out alot. It gives you direction to what material you learn, where
    you learn it, and most importantly why. That why gives you motivation to keep going. Which is essential for
    succeeding in this field. As a wise man Ralph Waldo Emerson said <em>"Life makes way for a man who know where he's going".</em> If you're having a hard time figuring out what programming field you want to go into I suggest looking at this <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/coding-jobs" target="_blank">nice article</a></p>

<h2>2. Be consistent</h2>

<p>While motivation is great if you have it. But consistency and discipline is usually what gets you ahead. Here's the kicker,<b> if you
    wait until you feel like doing something, you won't get it done.</b> On the days where you just don't feel like
    coding here's my advice to get you up. Think of the first step you need to take. Then force yourself to do it as
    soon as you can. After that first step you can opt out. But most times you will be like "I'm already here so i might
    as well do more I guess.". Then two hours later you wonder where the time went. The time went into progress, thats
    where.</p>



    <h2>3 . Google!</h2>

    <p>Google is everyone's best friend. It knows everything you need to know. How to italicize text in HTML, make a function
        in Javascript, or neat little shortcuts to make navigating your IDE alot easier. It has it all! For one question google has atleast 3 billion answers for a simple question. Googling is a pivotal skill for every software engineer.
        Googling things doesn't make you stupid. It means you're willing to let go of your ego and pride to get stuff done. Which is a trait that is very useful beyond just coding.</p>
    
    <h2> 4. Don't just learn, build! </h2>

<p>Most people get caught up in the theory of coding and all the little questions. But honestly, if it doesn't get the
    project done; It doesn't really matter. Most of the learning comes from building projects and well coding!
    I spent alot of afternoons googling up like a thousand unimportant questions about coding. It didn't help me any, I
    should've been hitting the IDE. Optimizing things before necessary is one of the deadly sins of programming.
    Screwing around and messing up is something you will do the most in
    programming. No way around it.</p>

    <h2> 5. Never give up</h2>

    <p>Alot of times in your coding journey your gonna feel like giving up. You come across a problem and you feel like your
        coding journey is over. All the stuff you have to learn will seem overwhelming and endless. You will want to break
        your computer trying to make the syntax errors go away (Please don't do that.). It happens to everyone, none of this
        will just click. Pick your head up because here's the thing. No one knows what the heck they are doing around here.
        We just google what we need to know at the moment and keep it pushing. The world of software is so huge that trying
        to figure it all out is like trying to outrun a speeding bullet. Just take everything a day at a time and focus on
        what you have to do at the moment. Trust the process.</p>

    <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>

    <p>So, that was alot. Hopefully you read all of it, it's pretty good information. This list was based off of my mistakes. I screwed up but you don't have to. Thank you for reading you all. </p>
